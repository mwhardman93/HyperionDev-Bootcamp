Write code that will do the following:

1) Allow the user to choose which calulation they want to do. This should be the first output:
	Investment 	- to calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment.
	Bond		- to calculate the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan.

	Enter either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu above to proceed:

2) How the user capitalises their selection should not affect the program!
eg/ 'Bond', 'bond', 'BOND' should all be valid entries
If the use doesn't type a valid input, show an appropriate error message

3) If 'investment' is selected:
	Ask the user to input:
	- The amount of money that they are depositing.
	- The interest rate (as percentage), only the number needs to be entered. eg/ 8 and not 8%.
	- The number of years they plan on investing.
	- Then ask the user if they want 'simple' or 'compound' interest, store this in a variable 'interest'.
	- Depending on whether it is 'simple' or 'compound' interest, output the appropriate amount they will 
	  get back after the given period at the specified interest rate using the below formula:
		- Interest formula:
			r = the interest entered above divided by 100
			P = the amount the user deposits
			t = the number of years the money is being invested
			A = the total amount once the interest has been applied
		Simple interest (A = P(1 + r x t) --> A = P * (1 + r*t)
		Compound interest (A = P(1 + r)^t) --> A = P * math.pow((1+r),t)
	- Print out the answer.
	- Try entering 20 years and 8% and see what the difference is depending on the type of interest.

4) If 'bond' is selected:
	Ask the user to input:
	- The present value of the house.
	- The interest rate.
	- The number of months they plan to take toi repay the bond.
		- Bond formula:
			P = present value of the house.
			i = monthly interest rate (caculated by dividing annual interest rate by 12, after converting input to percentage (input/100)).
			n = the number of months over which the bond is repaid.
		repayment = (i * P )/(1 - (1 + i)**(-n))
	- Output the answer for how much the user will have to repay each month.
